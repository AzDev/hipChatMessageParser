This is a doctest based on negative cases for hipchat.py
Each '>>' line is run as if in a python shell, and counts as a test.
The next line, if not '>>' is the expected output of the previous line.
If anything doesn't match exactly (including trailing spaces), the test fails.
run it as it described below:
  python -m doctest negative_tests.txt
  python -m doctest -v negative_tests.txt

>>> from hipchat import MessageParser
>>> hipTest_1 = MessageParser('@chris; you around? <a href="http://www.google.com">google site</a>', autoparsing=False)
>>> hipTest_1.get_title('ww.g.om')
'unable to read title'
>>> hipTest_1.string = "<a hef=>gogle"
>>> hipTest_1.get_links
